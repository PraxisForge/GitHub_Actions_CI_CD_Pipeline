GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline Guide
This guide provides a structured approach to implementing a basic CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, following official GitHub documentation standards.

Overview
GitHub Actions enables automation of software workflows through CI/CD pipelines directly within GitHub repositories. Workflows are defined in YAML files and execute based on specified events (e.g., code pushes, pull requests).

Prerequisites
A GitHub repository

Read/Write access to the repository

Basic understanding of YAML syntax

Implementation Steps
1. Create Workflow File
Navigate to your repository's .github/workflows/ directory

Create a new YAML file (e.g., ci-cd.yml)

2. Define Workflow Structure
yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18.x

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
3. Configure Deployment (Optional)
Add deployment job after testing:

yaml
  deploy:
    needs: build-and-test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:
      name: production
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.url }}
    
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v2
4. Commit and Trigger Workflow
Commit the workflow file to your repository

Push changes to the main branch

Monitoring Workflows
Access Execution Data
Navigate to Actions tab in your repository

Select the workflow run from the left sidebar

Analyze:

Real-time execution logs

Job status indicators (✅ Success/❌ Failure)

Artifact outputs (if configured)

Best Practices
Version Pinning: Always specify action versions (e.g., actions/checkout@v4)

Secrets Management: Use encrypted secrets for sensitive data

Matrix Testing: Test across multiple OS/runtime versions

Caching: Optimize build times with dependency caching

yaml
- name: Cache node modules
  uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: node_modules
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('package-lock.json') }}
