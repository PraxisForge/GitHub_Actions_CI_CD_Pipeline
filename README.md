# 🚀 GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline Guide

This guide provides a structured approach to implementing a basic CI/CD pipeline using **GitHub Actions**, following official GitHub documentation standards.

---

## 📌 Overview

[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) enables automation of software workflows through CI/CD pipelines directly within your GitHub repository. Workflows are defined in YAML files and execute based on events such as code pushes or pull requests.

---

## ✅ Prerequisites

- A GitHub repository
- Read/Write access to the repository
- Basic understanding of YAML syntax

---

## ⚙️ Implementation Steps

### 1. Create Workflow File

- Navigate to your repository's `.github/workflows/` directory  
- Create a new YAML file (e.g., `ci-cd.yml`)

### 2. Define Workflow Structure

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18.x

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

3. Configure Deployment (Optional)
Add a deployment job after testing:

  deploy:
    needs: build-and-test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:
      name: production
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.url }}

    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v2

4. Commit and Trigger Workflow
Commit the workflow file to your repository

Push changes to the main branch to trigger execution

📊 Monitoring Workflows
Navigate to the Actions tab in your repository

Select a workflow run from the sidebar to inspect:

✅ Real-time execution logs

❌ Job status indicators

📦 Artifact outputs (if configured)

on	Event triggers for workflow execution	Events Reference
jobs	Groups of tasks that run in isolated environments	Jobs Reference
steps	Individual commands or actions within a job	Steps Reference
environments	Define deployment targets and protection rules	Environments Guide

✅ Best Practices
Version Pinning: Always specify action versions (e.g., actions/checkout@v4)

Secrets Management: Use GitHub Secrets to securely store API keys and credentials

Matrix Testing: Test across multiple OS and runtime versions

Caching: Optimize build speed with dependency caching:
- name: Cache node modules
  uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: node_modules
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('package-lock.json') }}
