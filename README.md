# üöÄ GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline Guide

This guide provides a structured approach to implementing a basic CI/CD pipeline using **GitHub Actions**, following official GitHub documentation standards.

---

## üìå Overview

[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) enables automation of software workflows through CI/CD pipelines directly within your GitHub repository. Workflows are defined in YAML files and execute based on events such as code pushes or pull requests.

---

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

- A GitHub repository
- Read/Write access to the repository
- Basic understanding of YAML syntax

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Steps

### 1. Create Workflow File

- Navigate to your repository's `.github/workflows/` directory  
- Create a new YAML file (e.g., `ci-cd.yml`)

### 2. Define Workflow Structure

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18.x

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
