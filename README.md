# üöÄ GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline Guide
---

## üìå Overview

[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) enables automation of software workflows through CI/CD pipelines directly within your GitHub repository. Workflows are defined in YAML files and execute based on events such as code pushes or pull requests.

---

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

- A GitHub repository
- Read/Write access to the repository
- Basic understanding of YAML syntax

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Steps

### 1. Create Workflow File

- Navigate to your repository's `.github/workflows/` directory  
- Create a new YAML file (e.g., `ci-cd.yml`)

### 2. Define Workflow Structure

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18.x

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
```
### 3. Configure Deployment (Optional)

Add a deployment job after testing:

```yaml
  deploy:
    needs: build-and-test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:
      name: production
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.url }}

    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v2
```

### 4. Commit and Trigger Workflow

* Commit the workflow file to your repository
* Push changes to the `main` branch to trigger execution

---

## üìä Monitoring Workflows

* Navigate to the **Actions** tab in your repository
* Select a workflow run from the sidebar to inspect:

  * ‚úÖ Real-time execution logs
  * ‚ùå Job status indicators
  * üì¶ Artifact outputs (if configured)

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

* **Version Pinning**: Always specify action versions (e.g., `actions/checkout@v4`)
* **Secrets Management**: Use [GitHub Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) to securely store API keys and credentials
* **Matrix Testing**: Test across multiple OS and runtime versions
* **Caching**: Optimize build speed with dependency caching:

```yaml
- name: Cache node modules
  uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: node_modules
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('package-lock.json') }}
```
