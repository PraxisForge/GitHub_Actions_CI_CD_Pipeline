# GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline Guide

This guide provides a structured approach to implementing a basic CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, following official GitHub documentation standards.

## Overview

GitHub Actions enables the automation of software workflows through CI/CD pipelines directly within GitHub repositories. Workflows are defined in YAML files and execute based on specified events (e.g., code pushes, pull requests).

## Prerequisites

* A GitHub repository
* Read/Write access to the repository
* Basic understanding of YAML syntax

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Create Workflow File

* Navigate to your repository's `.github/workflows/` directory.
* Create a new YAML file (e.g., `ci-cd.yml`).

### 2. Define Workflow Structure

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18.x

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
3. Configure Deployment (Optional)Add a deployment job after testing:  deploy:
    needs: build-and-test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:
      name: production
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.url }}

    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v2
4. Commit and Trigger WorkflowCommit the workflow file to your repository.Push changes to the main branch.Monitoring WorkflowsAccess Execution DataNavigate to the "Actions" tab in your repository.Select the workflow run from the left sidebar.Analyze:Real-time execution logsJob status indicators (✅ Success/❌ Failure)Artifact outputs (if configured)Key ConceptsComponentDescriptionOfficial DocumentationonEvent triggers for workflow executionEvents ReferencejobsCollection of executable tasksJobs ReferencestepsSequential operations within a jobSteps ReferenceenvironmentsDeployment targets with protection rulesEnvironments GuideBest PracticesVersion Pinning: Always specify action versions (e.g., actions/checkout@v4).Secrets Management: Use encrypted secrets for sensitive data.Matrix Testing: Test across multiple OS/runtime versions.Caching: Optimize build times with dependency caching.- name: Cache node modules
